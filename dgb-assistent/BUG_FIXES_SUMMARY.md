# Bug Fixes Summary - DGB Assistent

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Group Function in "Gruppér billede" Not Working ✅

**Problem**: The group processor had incomplete grouping functionality - buttons did nothing and drag/drop wasn't implemented.

**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned the group processor interface with proper left/right layout
- Added functional image selection system (click to select images with visual feedback)
- Implemented working group management:
  - Create new groups with proper dialog
  - Visual group display with image lists
  - "Add Selected to Group" functionality
  - Remove group functionality
- Fixed the image processing pipeline to properly handle grouped images
- Added proper mousewheel scrolling for both image area and groups area
- Fixed threading issues in group processing with proper lambda closures

**Files Modified**:
- `src/apps/image_tools/group_processor.py` - Major interface redesign and functionality implementation

### 2. Individual Processor Missing Mousewheel Scrolling ✅

**Problem**: In the individual photo processor, you had to use the scrollbar to navigate through the list of pictures instead of being able to use the scroll wheel.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive mousewheel binding to the naming canvas
- Implemented recursive mousewheel binding for all child widgets
- Added focus management to ensure scroll wheel works when hovering over different areas
- Bound mousewheel to newly created image naming rows

**Files Modified**:
- `src/apps/image_tools/individual_processor.py` - Enhanced scrolling functionality

### 3. File Dialogs Going Behind Main Window ✅

**Problem**: When clicking to add photos, the file selection dialog would appear behind the main window instead of staying in front.

**Solution**:
- Added proper window focus management before opening file dialogs
- Implemented temporary topmost window behavior to ensure dialogs appear in front
- Added `parent=self.window` parameter to all dialog calls for proper modal behavior
- Applied fixes to all file dialogs across all three image processors:
  - File selection dialogs
  - Save ZIP dialogs  
  - Save directory selection dialogs

**Files Modified**:
- `src/apps/image_tools/group_processor.py` - Fixed all file dialogs
- `src/apps/image_tools/individual_processor.py` - Fixed all file dialogs
- `src/apps/image_tools/simple_resizer.py` - Fixed all file dialogs
- `src/gui/main_window.py` - Enhanced app launching with proper focus management

## Technical Details

### Window Focus Management Pattern Used:
```python
# Bring window to front before showing dialog
if self.window:
    self.window.lift()
    self.window.attributes('-topmost', True)
    self.window.update()
    self.window.attributes('-topmost', False)

# Show dialog with proper parent
dialog_result = filedialog.askopenfilenames(
    title="Dialog Title",
    filetypes=file_types,
    parent=self.window  # This ensures modal behavior
)
```

### Mousewheel Binding Pattern:
```python
# Bind mousewheel to canvas and scrollable frame
self.canvas.bind("<MouseWheel>", self.on_mousewheel)
self.scrollable_frame.bind("<MouseWheel>", self.on_mousewheel)

# Recursive binding for dynamic content
def bind_mousewheel_recursive(widget):
    widget.bind("<MouseWheel>", self.on_mousewheel)
    for child in widget.winfo_children():
        bind_mousewheel_recursive(child)
```

### Group Selection System:
- Click on images to select/deselect (blue border when selected)
- Create groups with custom names
- Add selected images to groups with visual feedback
- Process groups with letter suffixes (a, b, c, etc.)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Group Processor**: 
   - Select multiple images
   - Create 2-3 groups
   - Select images and add them to different groups
   - Verify processing works with proper naming (Group a, Group b, etc.)

2. **Individual Processor**:
   - Select many images (10+)
   - Verify scroll wheel works in the naming area
   - Test that all widgets respond to mouse wheel

3. **File Dialogs**:
   - Test in all three processors
   - Verify dialogs appear in front of windows
   - Test both file selection and save dialogs

## Notes

- All syntax errors have been checked and resolved
- Import issues with tkinter.simpledialog have been fixed
- Proper error handling added with parent window references
- Threading issues in group processing resolved with proper lambda closures
